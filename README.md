# Search Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms from the field of AI, including:

- Uninformed Search Algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Uniform Cost Search
  - Depth Limited Search
  - Iterative Deepening Search

- Informed Search Algorithms:
  - WIP

The goal of this project is not to provide the best or fastest code possible, but to give an easy to understand implementation of the algorithms described above

Note: This project uses an implementatin of priority queues called OptimizedPriorityQueue (ver. 4.2.0) by BlueRaja: https://github.com/BlueRaja/High-Speed-Priority-Queue-for-C-Sharp
